# KitchenChaos
 Multiplayer Unity game done by following a course from CodeMonkey.

 Massive course that teaches Unity/C# basics like Character Controllers, collisions, C# events and further on more advanced topics like Unity multiplayer system
 with Unity Netcode for gameobjects, Lobby and Relay. Whole project is made by doing clean code, same quality that CodeMonkey himself uses in his own steam games.

 Audios, Containers and Food objects were downloaded.
